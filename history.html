            <p>The decision to start this club came from our shared desire to help ease the struggles of those in our community. We plan to take part in Habitat for Humanity builds, and meals for the homeless twice a week. Charity concerts feature local bands and craft classes will be held as well. We hope that all of this will help to community come together to have a good time and help those in need.</p>
